# WallRun
A simple game made with UE5 and C++ where the player is running away from a wall in an infinite side scroller.

It was one of the first game I made using C++ in UE 4. I had since sort of transitioned into using Blueprints for the most part but I missed C++ so I recreated it in UE 5.

Future Plans:- 
  1.Add a score system and UI elements.
  2.Replace the basic geometry assets with actual assets to give the game a visual theme.
  3.Add more types of level blocks to make the level more interesting and fun to play
  4.Have difficulty triggers based on score that make the simple and easy to navigate level blocks stop spawning and add more difficult blocks to the spawn list.
